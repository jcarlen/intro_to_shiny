The files *01-How-to-start, 02-How-to-start-2* and *03-How-to-start-3* are slides from R Studio which I condensed and cut down to make *How-to-start-condensed*.

Shiny_basics.R has a few of my notes to go along with the slides, but the code referenced by the slides is all in the code folder.

All credit is due to RStudio for creating these very helpful slides.
